# energy-bot
Friendly and community driven bot to be used with Energy Blast TradingView script or any other to place bybit orders via
web hooks. Designed to be deployed to Google Firebase to allow users who are not tech-savvy to easily set up energy bot. 
The bot only supports *Long market orders* at this time. All active orders and conditional orders are canceled when 
the bot receives an order. When energy bot receives a sell order the entire long position is closed no matter the number 
of contracts in the request. The symbol you are training *must be set to isolated margin* or the bot will fail.

*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! ALWAYS TEST IN BYBIT TEST BEFORE USING ON REAL MONEY!*

## Updating Configuration

You only need to run the functions:config:set commands for the values you want to change

Deploy command must always be run for any config values to take

```shell
cd %USERPROFILE% # for windows
cd $HOME # for mac os
cd energy-bot
firebase functions:config:set bot_1.api_key="REPLACE_WITH_BYBIT_API_KEY"
firebase functions:config:set bot_1.secret_key="REPLACE_WITH_BYBIT_SECRET_KEY"
firebase functions:config:set bot_1.mode="'test' for testnet bybit or 'live' for normal bybit"
firebase functions:config:set auth.key="REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_STRING_OF_LETTERS_AND_NUMBERS"
# NOTE you can repeat the bot config keys to support multiple bots by adding bot_2.api_key bot_2.secret_key bot_2.mode
# This can be repeated any number of times but must go in number order i.e. you cannot add bot_4.api_key without
# having a bot 1, 2, and 3 configured first
firebase deploy
```
