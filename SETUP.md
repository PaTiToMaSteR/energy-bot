3. Install Firebase CLI (This is a command line tool that is used to interact with google firebase platform and preform
   energy bot deployment)
    * Following instructions for your OS here https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli
4. Generate ByBit API keys (NOTE API KEYS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR 90 DAYS REMEMBER TO ROTATE THEM BEFORE THEY EXPIRE)
    * Login to bybit account
        * TestNet https://testnet.bybit.com/en-US/
        * MainNet https://www.bybit.com/
    * Navigate to api key generation page by hovering over your account name in the top right and selecting *API* 
    ![bybit-nav-to-api-key-page.png](doc-imgs/bybit-nav-to-api-key-page.png)
    * Click Create New Key
    ![bybit-create-api-key.png](doc-imgs/bybit-create-api-key.png)
    * On popout box
        * Enter energy-bot under Name field
        * Under *Add Your IP Address* section leave this blank (firebase does not have static ips)
        * Under *API Key permissions* section check *Positions* and *Orders*
        * Enter your Google 2FA code (if you do not have two factor enabled on your account you will have to enable it)
        * Click *Confirm* button
        ![bybit-create-api-key-pop-out.png](doc-imgs/bybit-create-api-key-pop-out.png)
        * A new window will pop up displaying your API keys copy them down to a safe location you will need them for the 
          next step (A password manager is a place good)
        * Once you have copied them down Click *Understood*

5. Deploy Bot to Firebase by running the following commands in your terminal of choice
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/PaTiToMaSteR/energy-bot.git
    cd energy-bot
    firebase login
    firebase use --add 
    # Select choice that begains with energy-bot and hit enter key, 
    # When prompted for alias enter 'live' and hit enter key
    firebase functions:config:set bot_1.api_key="REPLACE_WITH_BYBIT_API_KEY_FROM_STEP_4"
    firebase functions:config:set bot_1.secret_key="REPLACE_WITH_BYBIT_SECRET_KEY_FROM_STEP_4"
    firebase functions:config:set bot_1.mode="'test' for testnet bybit or 'live' for normal bybit"
    firebase functions:config:set auth_key="REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_STRING_OF_LETTERS_AND_NUMBERS"
    # NOTE you can repeat the bot config keys to support multiple bots by adding bot_2.api_key bot_2.secret_key bot_2.mode
    # This can be repeated any number of times but must go in number order i.e. you cannot add bot_4.api_key without
    # having a bot 1, 2, and 3 configured first
    firebase deploy
    ```
6. Confirm your bot loads (TODO document how to get url for specific user deployment)
    * In your web browser of choice go to https://${url}/scalper/up it should display *I'm live*
    ![up-response.png](doc-imgs/up-response.png)
        * If it does not you missed a step above or are using the wrong URL
    * In your web browser of choice go to https://${url}/scalper/config/validate it should display 
      *Configuration Validation Successful*
    ![config-validate-response.png](doc-imgs/config-validate-response.png)
        * If it does not there is a configuration issue look at the output it should tell you want is wrong
7. Step up complete you can now set up trading view alerts to energy-bot!
